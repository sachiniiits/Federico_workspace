# Federico — Hospital Administrative Operations Platform

Federico is a multi-tenant web application designed to streamline non-clinical hospital administrative operations, including patient registration, OPD/IPD separation, bed and ward management, non-clinical inventory tracking, dynamic role-based access control, resource-based revenue modeling, and transparent billing workflows.

> **Scope Note:** Federico is strictly a non-clinical system. It does not handle clinical diagnosis, medical prescriptions, or clinical decision support.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Tenancy & RBAC:** Organization-level data isolation with custom dynamic role and permission management.
- **Patient Intake & OPD/IPD Separation:** Online appointment booking, pre-registration review, OPD specialist consultations, and emergency admissions.
- **Bed & Ward Management:** Real-time bed occupancy tracking with automated admission cascades, transfer tracking, and discharge gating.
- **Clinical & Resource Service Logs:** Ward service logging and resource-based charging with dual-step finance approval before ledger entry.
- **Billing, Receipts & Revenue:** Itemized digital bill dispatch, insurance copay calculations, online/cash payment processing, and platform revenue modeling.

---

## Architecture Overview

Federico follows a layered clean architecture pattern:

```
Frontend (React 19 + Vite 8 SPA — components, hooks, ES modules, react-router-dom)
    │
    ▼ (REST API / Bearer Token & Per-Tab Session Isolation)
Express.js Routing & Middleware (Auth, Security/CSP, Multi-Tenancy, Dynamic RBAC)
    │
    ▼
Schema Validators & HTTP Controllers (Standardized API Envelopes)
    │
    ▼
Domain Services (Business Logic & State Transitions)
    │
    ▼
In-Memory Store (dataStore.js) with Crash-Safe Atomic Disk Persistence (db.json)
```

## User Roles & Portals

| Role | Entry Route | Key Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Platform Super User** | `/platform/platform-login.html` | Tenant provisioning, subscription plans, module flags, revenue tracking, and audit logs. |
| **Hospital Admin** | `/Admin/screen-01-dashboard.html` | Branch setup, custom dynamic RBAC roles, staff assignment, doctor catalog, and inventory catalogs. |
| **Hospital Operations (HOM)** | `/HOM/screen-01-dashboard.html` | Real-time bed allocation, ward occupancy matrix, service charge logging, and medical discharge readiness. |
| **Patient Registration (PRE)** | `/PRE/pages/PRE.html` | Pre-registration review, OPD appointments, emergency triage, and final administrative discharge. |
| **Finance Associate (FA)** | `/FA/fa-dashboard.html` | Service charge approvals, manual charge entries, bill dispatch, payment processing, and receipts. |
| **Patient** | `/Patient/patient-dashboard.html` | OPD specialist booking, insurance management, itemized bill review, and digital payments. |

Signing in routes each role to its own portal automatically. The full route table is
in [`front-end/README.md`](front-end/README.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.19+ or v22.12+ (required by Vite 8)
- npm (v9 or higher)

Run the backend and the frontend in two separate terminals.

### 1. Backend — `http://localhost:3000`
```bash
cd back-end
npm install

# Development mode with nodemon
npm run start:dev

# or production start
npm start
```
- Health Check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- API Documentation (Swagger): `http://localhost:3000/api`

### 2. Frontend — `http://localhost:5173`
```bash
cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173/`, which redirects to the landing page.

The frontend defaults to an API on `http://localhost:3000`. To point it elsewhere,
copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_API_URL`.

### Production build
```bash
cd front-end
npm run build      # bundles into dist/
npm run preview    # serves dist/ with the same URL rewriting as dev
```
Routes keep their legacy `.html` suffixes, so **any production host needs a SPA
fallback rewrite** to `index.html` or every deep link 404s. See
[`front-end/README.md`](front-end/README.md) for the nginx example and the full route
table.

## Demo Credentials

| Role | Email | Password |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Platform Super User** | `platform@federico.com` | `Federico@Platform123` |
| **Hospital Admin** | `owner@hosp.com` | `Owner@123` |
| **Hospital Operations (HOM)** | `admin@hosp.com` | `Hom@123` |
| **Patient Registration (PRE)** | `rekha.pre@hosp.com` | `Pre@123` |
| **Finance Associate (FA)** | `farah.fa@hosp.com` | `Fa@123` |
| **Patient** | `arjun.k@hosp.com` | `Hamiz@123` |

## Automated Testing

Run the test suite from the `back-end` directory:

```bash
cd back-end
npm test
```

All 20 test suites (101 tests) cover unit tests, security middleware, data integrity, tenant boundary isolation, dynamic RBAC, OPD/IPD separation, platform marketplace revenue, and the full multi-role inpatient admission and discharge lifecycle.
